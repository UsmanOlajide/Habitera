Jan 4
- Clean up the code
- Remove the if-else statement in the habits screen
- Added a getter in the Greeting enum to handle the currentGreeting instead.
   -This way all the logic is in the enum.
- Created a repo for the app
- Fix issue where the greeting's state only updated by hot restart, 
   - so I made sure the greeting text state changes with the appropriate hour
